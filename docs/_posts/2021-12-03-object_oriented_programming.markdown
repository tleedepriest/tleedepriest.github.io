# The Old
I have been taking a break from my BJJ Lineage Project. After I found out how to upload files to Amazon S3 bucket, I was happy with the progress I have made so far. The project taught me how to Orchestrate Pipelines in Luigi, Upload Files to an S3 bucket in the cloud, and the importance of not over-engineering something right from the get go.

I was able to take the knowledge I gained from building a simple pipeline on my github, and apply that knowledge at work. I am currently migrating a pipeline from GNU Make to Luigi, and I have learned a lot more about Luigi! It currently has over 300 tasks. I have also learned about several pitfalls of Luigi. For example, when webscraping, Luigi doesn't have a convienent way to 'fail silently'. I will make a seperate post about this.


# The New - Object-Oriented Programming
Since then, I have started a new project on Generative Art. The project is a bit more exciting than the BJJ Lineage because it allows me to express my creativity, and I am learning a lot more skills I haven't previously developed that much - OOP.

My plan is to build a codebase that will allow me to express myself creativly with generative art.

I stumbled upon this [book](http://hplgit.github.io/primer.html/doc/pub/oo/oo-readable.html), which shows object oriented programming through the lense of drawing shapes. Funnily enough I wrote very similar Circle classes, with draw methods, as they are described in this book.
