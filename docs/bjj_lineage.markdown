I created this image using an automated pipeline that collects data from the website bjjheros.com, transforms the HTML files into text, extracts the relevant lineage from each page, deduplicates the data, cleans the data, and transforms the data into a child-parent entity relationship.

Finally the data is further transformed using the networkx package to display the tree you see here.
