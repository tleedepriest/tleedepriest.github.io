[Garry Tonon vs Dante Leon - 2019 ADCC World Championships](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPFIX9c4UV0)

Garry Tonon hits a very interesting Iminari Roll from the top position to enter an inside heelhook. He also uses his thumb to break a body lock during Dante Leon's back attempt. 

Finally, Gary hits an outside heelhook at the end.
