# Travis DePriest

- B.S in Physics (Virginia Tech)
- M.A.Ed in Curriculum and Instruction (Virginia Tech)
- Brown Belt in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and previous instructor at [High Noon BJJ](https://highnoonbjj.com/team/), having competed at the highest level against some of the best in the world.

After teaching High School Physics (from the level of English Language Learner to AP Physics) for three years at two separate schools, I fell back to my roots as a researcher and started as a Research Associate at [IDA](https://www.ida.org/) in the Information and Technology and Systems Division. I quickly learned Python, and have been accelerating my technical skills for the past two years. My growth truly feels exponential!

On The upswing of my exponential journey, I've started this blog as I transition from Research Associate/ Data Analyst into a Data Engineering role. **Join me on this journey** as I showcase my path towards becoming a **Data Engineer**.
This is my website I'll be populating with projects I complete as I continue my path towards self-teaching data engineering.
